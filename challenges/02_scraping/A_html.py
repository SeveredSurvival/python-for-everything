# In this challenge, you are going to practice handling HTML formatted data

## 1. Use requests to download the page at "isitchristmas.com"

import requests

page = get('http://isitchristmas.com')

## 2. Pull out the title and any paragraphs of the site

title =

text =

## 3. Pull out the site header, and join all of the elements in the head into a single text string.

head = ' '.join(things_in_head_object)

## 4. Compare the length of the header to the length of the text - what do you notice? If you really want to blow your mind, open this up in a browser and compare the human-rendered version with the source code.
