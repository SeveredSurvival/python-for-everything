# Welcome to your second challenge! Below are a couple of examples of
# incorrect python syntax. Fix them to pass the tests!

## 1. Create a string object of the numbers from one to three

counting_numbers = "one two four'

## 2. Write a function that replaces every occurance of 'three' with 'five'
## and then returns it

def arthurify()
    string.replace('five', 'three')
    return string

## The stuff below here is okay -- no need to fix it!
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('BROTHER MAYNARD: Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.')
    print('ARTHUR: Right.')
    for number in counting_numbers.split():
        print('ARTHUR:', arthurify(number))
