# In this challenge you are going to practice basic pandas functionality
# by using a table of peoples' heights and a table of cities' heights
# to compute a variable representing 100 person's absolute height
# above sea level

# 1. Read in the first hundred lines of the csv located at
# data/03_people as person_data


# 2. Now, read in the csv file located at data/03_cities, merge it
# into person_data and call it all_data


# 3. Finally, create a new variable called "height_above_sea", and
# write that data frame to disk at data/height_above_sea.csv
