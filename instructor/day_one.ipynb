    "### Interpreted\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language. This means that, instead of being translated into a string of bits or bytes that is submitted directly to the machine, python code is submitted line by line to a program that decides what to do with each line. There are many ways to interact with this program. The simplest is:\n",

    "#### 2. You can submit commands to python via a terminal-interpreter\n",

    "> IPython is a popular option for developers who are prototyping code, and need to try out different implentations in real time. This is also true of the people of develop IPython, who report adopting a two-window setup where one window is IPython and the other is a text editor (like Vi, Sublime, or Atom). Two fantastic features of IPython are tab complete and the documentation lookup operator. Try typing `pri <tab>` into your interpreter. It should auto-complete to `print`. Add a `?` immediately after `print` and hit enter. You should see the docstring like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> The same people who make IPython also make Jupyter, which provides a notebook-like format for python similar to Mathematica or Rmd, where code, code output, text, and graphics can be combined into a single filetype that can be viewed and run by others in real time. Quit IPython (do you remember how?) and type `jupyter notebook` into your terminal. It will display some output like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[I 13:59:34.497 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /Users/dillonniederhut/python-for-everything\n",

    "[I 13:59:34.497 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).\n",
    "```\n",

    "> And then will open up your default browser (or open a tab in the browser you already have running) and display the local filesystem. From here, you can start a new notebook by clicking the 'new' button on the righthand side of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important! You can't do anything in the terminal while the notebook is running.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Notebooks are not typically used for development or production, but are very common in teaching environments. For example, this teaching materials for this class were all created in Jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. You can run python in an IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "> IDE stands for 'Integrated Development Environment', and is a graphical user interface that typically includes an output window, a text editor with built-in `run` and `debug` functions, display windows for plots and filesystems, and some amount of declaration tracking. In this class, we'll be using [Rodeo](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/introducing-rodeo.html), a lean IDE that uses IPython as its interpreter. There are many other choices, including:\n",
    "* IDLE - [Python's built-in IDE](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/idle.html) (no one really uses this)\n",
    "* Spyder - [IDE that ships with Anaconda](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder) (similar to Rodeo)\n",
    "* PyCharm - [JetBrain's IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (feature-heavy; includes VCS support and cross-referencing)\n",
    "You should already have Rodeo installed - double click the icon (wherever you put it) to start up the program."
