    "We've spent a lot of time in python dealing with text data, and that's because text data is everywhere. It is the primary form of communication between persons and persons, persons and computers, and computers and computers. The kind of inferential methods that we apply to text data, however, are different from those applied to tabular data. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is partly because documents are typically specified in a way that expresses both structure and content using text (i.e. the document object model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Largely, however, it's because text is difficult to turn into numbers in a way that preserves the information in the document. Today, we'll talk about dominant language model in NLP and the basics of how to implement it in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The term-document model\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also sometimes referred to as \"bag-of-words\" by those who don't think very highly of it. The term document model looks at language as individual communicative efforts that contain one or more tokens. The kind and number of the tokens in a document tells you something about what is attempting to be communicated, and the order of those tokens is ignored.\n",

The `+` means to match at least one but possibly more, and the `?` tells the `+` not to be greedy.
