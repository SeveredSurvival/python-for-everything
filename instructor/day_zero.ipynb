In the grand scheme of computer software, object orientation is a way of organizing code such that it is easy to update without breaking. This means grouping functions that serve a similar purpose into hierarchies. However, stating it this way is confusing and abstract.\n",

It's simpler to know that balls generaly bounce than to explicitly declare for every ball I ever see in my entire life whether it bounces or not. I can't bounce you, for example, but you didn't need to tell me that when I met you. If I came to believe that people were bounce-able, I would update my idea of people generally, not every person specifically."
