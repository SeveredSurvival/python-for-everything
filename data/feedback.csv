2015-02-27,6,2,NA,7,NA,"I know this workshop was off to a bit of a rocky start because of the computer problems and maybe more rushed than usual but it was difficult to follow for a couple of reasons.
1.) The instructor went over the material very rapidly and didn't stop at any point to ask if we had questions.  Pausing and taking questions at the end of each segment or even several times during each segment would have gone a long way to make the material clearer.  He also had another instructor answering questions while he was lecturing, which posed an additional challenge to being able to listen to his lecture while trying to tune out the other instructor who was answering questions simultaneously 

2.) The workshop was advertised as only needing a beginning level of familiarity with Stata.  But the instructor used a lot of terms that aren't necessarily familiar to people with just an introductory level of familiarity with Stata (e.g. macros, local and global elements, LaTex etc.) without taking the time to clearly define what these terms means, why they are of importance, etc. before launching into the details associated with them, which also made the workshop difficult to follow.  Again, slowing down, and not assuming audience familiarity with the content would have gone a long way to promoting a friendlier environment for learning.

The instructor clearly has a lot of knowledge but needs more practice with how to communicate this knowledge to others who are less advanced.

As an undergraduate student in political science (exchange), i am rarely confronted to practical data analysis during classes. I had a previous experience in statistics and learnt the basis of Stata on the internet, but I felt really behind during the intermediate Stata workshop, which I think i will take again in April. It would be awesome if you could offer more class providing non-computer scientists basic trainings (even in Excell...) It would make social scientists (especially girls) less afraid of numbers and far from  computers. It is necessary for me -i want to do research- to be able to find basic information on a data set, to manipulate it etc. and it is sometimes depressing and less efficient in the long-run to learn it by oneself on the internet.

2014-11-15,2,2,"Found it on the D-Lab website",7,"Sociology","I think this training could have benefited from a bit more structure. One of the participants in the workshop mentioned what would have been a nice way to start: with an overview of the software, its current capabilities, and how it got to that point (i.e., I thought it was interesting that it was mostly project-driven, which gives some insight into how the tool behaves). We got to that information only after about 75 minutes of sort of floundering around without much direction. 

A little more explanation was required across the board. So, maybe after the potential introduction described above, there could have been a minute or two on what tasks we would be doing. Something like, ""We're going to find a mailing list and run some software that parses the headers to give us an idea of the structure of the list user community; then we'll move on to how that community might relate to other communities."" Basically, I wasn't sure (and probably am still not sure) what the software could do. So, although that might seem overly-structured, I think that a little structure is needed when people are being introduced to something completley new.

This probably is specific to me, but I mention it just for something to consider. I have several  (antiquated) years experience developing database management software in Python. However,  I was a little mystified because I had done that work in vi or emacs, not the Python environment. I think just a brief intro to that environment would have helped me out. So, although that wasn't a major limiting factor and although this was an intermediate course, some assumptions that were made about what that meant (on my end and Sebastian's) that made things a little more difficult at the get-go. 

Finally, I did enjoy learning about the tool. Although it's not quite at the stage where I could apply it immediately, it did spark my imagination. So, thanks!",5,"Female/Woman","White",4,1,NA,NA

I want to point out to a few things that I thought could be improved. The code that was provided was giving errors during the presentation which is something that can be easily fixed. Also it would be great to have some practice exercises at the end. So maybe a two day training where first day for covering the materials to be learned and the second day an hour of going through some practice exercises. Another thing is that a step by step guide to how to obtain the keys would also make the material more immediately applicable. Once again thanks for taking the time to put together this training.

Also, training on using software for network analysis, even for descriptive purposes, would be helpful.  (UCI Net is one I think?)  Also training in HLM using SPSS would be useful to me.

I use a lot of complicated multi-level data.  I have organizational level survey data with some qualitative components.  I'm also working on a project that combines individual, organizational level, and market level data (hence the need for HLM).  I often combine qualitative and quantitative data in the same project.  My data are messy - usually I collect them myself rather than relying on government databases -- and involve a lot of missing data.  Techniques for imputing missing data would be another area where a class or training would be useful.  I have a project where I'm combining organizational level data with Census data and using GIS approaches to look at access to justice across the United States - figuring out how to code street addresses and combing information across these sources was a nightmare.

My technical challenges are both logistical and methodological.  Logistically, I spend too much time tracking down software, software licenses, and keeping them current.  Also, I use so  many different programs that the licenses tend to drain my research account.  If the university had site licenses and a transparent way of getting these programs to folks it would be a tremendous help to  myself and my graduate students.  I also have technical challenges managing collaboration with folks at other universities in a way that keeps data involving human subjects secure.  

The other challenges have to do with modeling and data management.  I often find I can get 80% of the way there on paper, but would benefit from some targeted consulting/instruction to finish up a project.  Finding the time and expertise to do that is a problem.  If there were someone to call for assistance when I reach that point it would be tremendously helpful.  Also, often myself and my graduate students will have some similar research challenges using GIS or NVIVO, and we would really benefit from a two hour class with some intensive consulting on our particular projects.  It would be great if it were possible to set up something like that where we could work on the actual projects we are struggling with.",5,"Female/Woman","White",2,1,NA,NA

While I don't have a background in econ or conduct any research myself, I was hoping to get a very basic intro to the STATA. I also don't have any coding background or experience. Perhaps this course was intended for people with a basic nuts-and-bolts understanding of STATA already, but based on the title, I was under the impression it would be completely beginners-level. If there are others like me registering for future classes, here's how I think the delivery could be improved.

-Introduction to basic vocab and terms, and definitions
-Introduction to basic syntax commands and the corresponding performing function
-Clear and simple case study selected in advance to demo and ""play"" with
-Laser pointer or enlarged cursor to clearly indicate tabs/etc on projected screen so

Thank you for offering these classes!",2,"Female/Woman","White",1,1,NA,NA
